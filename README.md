# Six-Week Independent Reader Curriculum Blueprint

This project aims to establish foundational skills for independent readers within the first six weeks of school. The blueprint is a living document that can be reviewed, refined, and reused year after year.

## Key Components

- **Reading Stamina**: Building students' ability to read for extended periods
- **"Fit Book" Selection**: Teaching students how to choose books that match their reading level and interests
- **Reading Partnerships**: Developing meaningful peer discussions about books
- **Assessment & Tracking**: Using checklists and observation tools to monitor progress

## Repository Structure

- `01-mini-lessons/`: Short, targeted lessons on specific reading skills
- `02-partnership-resources/`: Worksheets, prompts, and goal-setting sheets for reading partnerships
- `03-assessment-checklists/`: Tools for tracking student progress

## Workflow

This repository demonstrates a complete curriculum development workflow using GitHub:
1. **Identify Needs** using Issues
2. **Develop Solutions** using Pull Requests
3. **Review & Integrate** resources into the curriculum
